Patch 1.2.0.14

Fixed technical edge case that could cause errors in enemy spawning (might solve the Thorium + DLC spawns issue)
Used new variable for tracking desert scourge's passive timer instead of AI variable, which caused issues with other mods
Fixed both Rogue weapons being able to stealth strike at once with Apprentice Support
Fixed certain conflicting balance changes not being handled correctly
Russian localization changes/cleanups
